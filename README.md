# Meetly
Meetly is a student-centric online meeting platform built using the MERN stack, designed to make virtual classes and meetings more interactive and engaging.
It provides real-time chat, smart polls, and an AI-assisted chat feature that can be accessed using @MeetlyAI directly inside the meeting chat.

Unlike basic meeting clones, Meetly focuses on interaction and participation by integrating features such as live polling and intelligent, context-aware chat assistance.
The platform supports real-time communication using Socket.io and is structured to be scalable and easy to extend with future enhancements like video conferencing using WebRTC.
